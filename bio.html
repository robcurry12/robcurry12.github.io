						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							I graduated magna cum laude from Dowling College in May of 2016 with a Bachelors of Science in computer science and mathematics. I compiled a 3.76 GPA in 
							computer science & mathematics and an overall GPA of 3.83 during my four years at Dowling.
						</p>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							The coursework throughout my time at Dowling College has exposed me to a smorgasbord of programming languages, techniques, and styles. 
							I have worked closely and intensely with the some of the biggest web technologies such as JQuery, PHP, and HTML/CSS. The "Portfolio" section of this website offers 
							samples of my work that you can check out.
						</p>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from academics, I also was employed at the Dowling College Help Desk as a Work Study technician from September 2012 to May 2016. 
							Providing technical support to the college community was apart of my duties as Help Desk technician.
						</p>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							Currently, I am employed at Artbean Inc, an E-commerce start-up company as an IT Specialist/Web Developer. Aside from providing technical support to the office staff,
							 I am also deeply involved with the website development process. Collaborating with off-shore developers, vigorous QA testing, and providing improvements to the 
							 website are just some of my daily tasks. This position has exposed me to not only the web developement process but it has allowed me to be deeply immersed in the 
							 marketing, SEO/SEM, and backend architeture aspects of the website.
						</p>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							In my spare time, I work on coding personal side projects for personal consumption, some of which can be found at my Github. Coding in my free time is one of my 
							favorite past times as it allows me to get creative. Occasionaly, I will explore CodeAcademy for new courses. Most recently, I picked up a lesson on React.js. 
							I also have a musical side that is expressed through my Youtube Channel. I post drum covers of popular songs for entertainment and constructive criticism. 
							I have also experimented with audio and video editing with my drum covers as well as other Youtube projects.
						</p>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							Achieving high grades while involving myself in a variety of hobbies and interests was made possible by my excellent time and stress management skills. 
							These are skills I utilize in all facets of my life to help keep things light for myself and others around me. I understand the importance of hustling, 
							hardworking, and perservering through adversity. However, I also understand the importance of relaxation and knowing your limits. To be successful in business 
							and in life, one must balance these two ideas effectively.
						</p>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							My eclectic collection of experiences, hobbies, and interests is what sets me apart from others. I have developed a unique mindset by being involved in these different 
							areas of concentration. I bring a multidimensional school of thought to the table which is crucial in life and especially in computer science where problem solving is key. 
							These are traits that I pride myself on and feel that I excel at. To wrap things up, when you engage Rob Curry, it is a pleasant, unique, one-of-a-kind experience. 
							I guarantee it!
