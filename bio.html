		     <h2 id="jack" class="quote"><i>"Jack of all trades, master of none, though oftentimes better than master of one"</i></h2>
		
		<p class="bio"> I graduated <i>magna cum laude</i> from Dowling College in May of 2016 with a Bachelors of Science in computer science and mathematics.
		I compiled a 3.76 GPA in computer science & mathematics and an overall GPA of 3.83 during my four years at Dowling.
		</p>
		<p class="bio">The coursework throughout my time at Dowling College has exposed me to a smorgasbord of programming languages, techniques,
		and styles. I have worked closely and intensely with the some of the biggest web technologies such as JQuery, PHP, and HTML/CSS.
		The "Portfolio" section of this website offers samples of my work that you can check out.</p>
	      	
		<p class="bio">Aside from academics, I also was employed at the Dowling College Help Desk as a Work Study technician from September 
		2012 to May 2016. Providing technical support to the college community was apart of my duties as Help Desk technician. </p>
		
		<p class="bio">Currently, I am employed at Artbean Inc, an E-commerce start-up company as an IT Specialist/Web Developer. Aside from providing
		technical support to the office staff, I am also deeply involved with the website development process. This position has exposed me to not only the web developement 
		process but it has allowed me to be deeply immersed in the marketing, SEO/SEM, and the backend architeture aspects of the website.
		</p>
		
		<p class="bio">In my spare time, I work on coding personal side projects for personal consumption, some of which can be found at my Github. Coding in my 
		free time is one of my favorite past times as it allows me to get creative. I also have a musical side that is expressed through my Youtube
		Channel. I post	drum covers of popular songs for entertainment and constructive criticism. I have also experimented with audio
		and video editing with my drum covers as well as other Youtube projects.</p>
		
		<p class ="bio">Achieving high grades while involving myself in a variety of hobbies and interests was made possible
		by my excellent time and stress management skills. These are skills I utilize in all facets of my life to help keep things
		light for myself and others around me. I understand the importance of hustling, hardworking, and perservering through adversity.
		However, I also understand the importance of relaxation and knowing your limits. To be successful in business and in life, one must
		balance these two ideas effectively.  
		</p>
		<p class="bottom p bio">My eclectic collection of experiences, hobbies, and interests is what sets me apart from others. I have
		developed a unique mindset by being involved in these different areas of concentration. I bring a multidimensional school of thought to
		the table which is crucial in life and especially in computer science where problem solving is key. These are traits that I pride myself on
		and feel that I excel at. To wrap things up, when you engage Rob Curry, it is a pleasant, unique, one-of-a-kind experience.
		I guarantee it!</p>
