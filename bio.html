		<p class="bio"> I am currently working towards a Bachelors of Science in computer science and mathematics at Dowling College. May of 2016
		is my anticipated date of graduation. I am forecasted to graduate with a cumulative GPA of 3.8 and a computer science
		cumulative GPA of 3.7.
		</p>
		
		<p class="bio">The coursework throughout my time at Dowling College as exposed me to a smorgasbord of programming languages, techniques,
		and styles. I have worked closely and intensely with the some of the biggest web technologies such as JQuery, PHP, and HTML/CSS.
		The "Portfolio" section of this website offers samples of my work that you can check out.</p>
	      	
		<p class="bio">Aside from academics, I have also been employed at the Dowling College Help Desk as a Work Study technician for
		the last four years. In my spare time, I occasionally will write articles for a fan run New York Mets fan-blog called The Rising Apple Blog at Fansided.com.
		I am strictly a	volunteer writer and write purely for pleasure. I also have a musical side that is expressed through my Youtube
		Channel. I post	drum covers of popular songs for entertainment and constructive criticism. I have also experimented with audio
		and video editing with my drum covers as well as other Youtube projects.</p>
		<p class ="bio">Achieving high grades while involving myself in a variety of hobbies and interests was made possible
		by my excellent time and stress management skills. These are skills I utilize in all facets of my life to help keep things
		light for myself and others around me. I understand the importance of hustling, hardworking, and perservering through adversity.
		However, I also understand the importance of relaxation and knowing your limits. To be successful in business and in life, one must
		balance these two ideas effectively.  
		</p>
		<p class="bottom p bio">My eclectic collection of experiences, hobbies, and interests is what sets me apart from others. I have
		developed a unique mindset by being involved in these different areas of concentration. I bring a multidimensional school of thought to
		the table which is crucial in life and especially in computer science where problem solving is key. These are traits that I pride myself on
		and feel that I excel at. To wrap things up, when you engage Rob Curry, it is a pleasant, unique, one-of-a-kind experience.
		I guarantee it!</p>
